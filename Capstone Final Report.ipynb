    "## __Introduction__\n",
    "\n",
    "A fast food franchise is trying open a new resturant in the US. They already have gotten a shop in most of the big cities, so this time they are looking for small cities. They found two candidates, Virginia Beach and Omaha. Now its your job to compare the two cities to find out where to place the location based on neighborhood agglomeration.\n",

    "## __Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is from Foursquare and Wikipedia to to get information on the neighborhoods, venues, the specific coordinates and more, in a addition to a variety of python packages including folium, geopy, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. For the Wikipedia pages, they include:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_of_Omaha,_Nebraska for Omaha and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Beach,_Virginia for Virginia beach.\n"
